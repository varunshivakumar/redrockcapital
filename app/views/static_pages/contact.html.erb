<h1>User Guide</h1>

<h4>Home Page:</h4>
- This is the landing page once the user types in www.redrockcapital.com (currently only being run from local server). From here the user will have two options, either go to sign up page or go to the login page. User decides which page to be navigated to via button click.

Sign Up Page:
-  This page is visited on the user's first visit to the site. Each user is required to create an account and specify the type of account they are creating. The types of account can be Customers, Employees, or Manager. The later two will require some form of verification as they allow for some visibility of other users data.

Login Page:
- The User will visit this page every time he/she is attempting to perform some sort of transaction within the system.
-  The user will type in their username/email in the designated text input field. Following that the user will type in their password, again in its designated text input field.
- Once both text fields have been populated, the User will press the login button and attempt to gain access to the system. At this point there are two possibilities, if the username and password combination is correct it will redirect the User to the their accounts homepage. Otherwise it will stay on the Login page and inform the user of an invalid/incorrect information input.
